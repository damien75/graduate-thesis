I would like to give my special and sincere thanks to Prof Kaleem Siddiqi who believed in my potential from the beginning and helped me get to McGill. I really appreciated how understanding he was when I had to face some health issues.

Mostly I would like to thank him for introducing me to this field and getting me to work with great and smart people in his network, as this is how I met my first post-graduation employer to name one of the many exciting opportunities I had in the course of my research.

I would also sincerely like to thank Emmanuel Piuze for sharing with me his experience and work in Kaleem's lab and making me want to work in this environment and on an extension of his work. He put a lot of effort which allowed me to quickly get up to speed and several of the experiments I carried out were facilitated by the algorithms and software implementations he had put into place.

Many thanks go to Mihaela Pop for being so supportive and available on all the projects that we worked on, and of course for the data she was kind enough to share with us to run our experiments on.

I would also like to thank Peter Savadjiev for helping me and clarifying obscure things on many occasions, Ryan Eckbo for sharing his precious knowledge and his help, and finally Babak Samari and Morteza Rezanejad who were so nice and welcoming in the lab.
